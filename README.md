# HumanCognition-StateSpace
A systems-level model of cognitive stability and learning efficiency under constraint.

## Overview
Human cognitive performance is often discussed in qualitative or static terms. This project models cognition as a resource-limited, dynamic system that evolves over time under constraint.

## Core Idea
Cognitive capacity, learning efficiency, and executive function interact nonlinearly with factors such as:
- Sleep debt
- Cognitive load
- Stress
- Recovery inputs
Small, cumulative constraints can push the system toward instability.

## Framework
This model is inspired by:
- HSI
- Cognitive Neuroscience
- State-space and control systems intuition
Key features:
- Explicit assumptions
- Noise and variability
- Degradation and recovery dynamics

## Why This Matters
Understanding cognition as a dynamic system has implications for:
- Learning design
- Neurodivergent support
- Human-in-the-loop engineering
- Sustainable performance under constraint

## Status
Initial conceptual model and prototype simulation.
